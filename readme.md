# Reserve

This is a Rust tool which @rpadaki uses to book Wednesday night trivia at Slainte using the Spothopper API. This achieved two major goals:

1. Do something entirely overkill.
2. Stop manually booking reservations every week.

Feel free to open a PR to add your favorite Spothopper restaurants!

This service can build natively for use in your terminal or a cron job. Or, it can compile to WebAssembly. You can then create an HTML frontend for this wasm, thereby completing the cycle by creating a user interface for something that initially had a user interface.
